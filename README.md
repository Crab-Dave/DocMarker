# DocMarker

Easy tool to mark docs.

**This tool is fully completed by ChatGPT 4o.**

## How to use

Place your lots of `.pdf` files and `.txt` files under `/documents`, and run `app.py`.

You can press ← to mark current file with color A and skip to next file, or press → to mark current file with color B and skip to next file.

You can also press ↑ or ↓ to switch among files without giving a mark.

You can press `筛选` button to filter some documents with mark A/B.

You can press `导出` button to copy the files with same marks into a folder under `/exports`.

**Maybe you should use `pip install` to prepare for some packages.**

## How did I developed

You can refer to `/documents/需求.txt`, that's my first prompt to chatgpt.

Then I just remind him and encouraged him to complete my plan.

## Further Plan

Because my chatgpt could not response now, so I'm not sure when to complete these.

1. Settings to change linked buttons and marking colors.

2. A zen mode to work more efficiently.

3. My midterm examination!
